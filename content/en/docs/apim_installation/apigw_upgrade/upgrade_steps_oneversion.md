After you **upgrade** your [API Gateway 7.5.x or 7.6.x](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_extcass/) to [API Gateway One Version](https://community.axway.com/s/question/0D52X00008WUjgeSAD/introducing-one-version-for-api-management), follow the instructions on this page to **update** your API Gateway One Version to the latest delivery.

* The [sysupgrade](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_script/) script is not used when updating to API Gateway One Version.
* If you have installed a licensed version of API Gateway One Version or API Manager One Version, you do not require a new license to install updates.

## Before you start

You must perform the following procedures to update from API Gateway One Version:

{{% alert title="Note" %}}All these steps are mandatory, and must be followed in this order.{{% /alert %}}

1. [Install an API Gateway server update](#install-an-api-gateway-server-update).
2. [Install a Policy Studio update](#install-a-policy-studio-update).
3. [Install a Configuration Studio update](#install-a-configuration-studio-update).
4. [Install an API Gateway Analytics update](#install-an-api-gateway-analytics-update).

## Install an API Gateway server update

If you have installed an existing version of API Manager, installing the **API Gateway server** update automatically also installs the updates and fixes for API Manager.

You can easily install API Gateway server update by running the `update_apigw.sh` script. The script performs the following:

* Check that the installation directory is valid.
* Check that the user who owns the API Gateway binaries is the same user running the `update_apigw.sh` script.
* Check that the Node Manager and API Gateway instances that run on the local machine are not running.
* Take a backup unless `--no_backup` has been specified.
* Install the update content into the API Gateway installation directory.

The script also performs all of the steps that were performed by a post installation script in earlier updates. This includes:

* JRE cleanup
* `system/lib/modules` cleanup
* Third-party and Axway JAR cleanup
* Apply `acl.json` fix
* Apply passphrase obfuscation fix
* Apply modifications to Node Manager entity store configuration.

Fixes are only applied if they have not previously been applied.

To install the update on your existing API Gateway 7.7 server installation, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that your existing API Gateway instance and Node Manager have been stopped.
2. Remove any previous patches from your `INSTALL_DIR/ext/lib` and `INSTALL_DIR/META-INF` directories (or the `ext/lib` directory in an API Gateway instance). These patches have already been included in this update. You do not need to copy patches from a previous version.
3. Download and unpack the API Gateway 7.7 server update file into a new directory. For example:

   ```
   mkdir 77update
   tar xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_Core_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C 77update
   ```

   {{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}You must extract the file into a new directory, and not into the existing API Gateway installation directory.{{< /alert >}}
4. Run the [`update_apigw.sh`](#update-apigw-sh-script)  script from the directory into which you extracted the update file (for example, `77update`) and specify your API Gateway installation directory using the `--install_dir` option. For example:

   ```
   ./update_apigw.sh --install_dir /opt/Axway-7.7/
   ```
5. Restart your Node Manager and API Gateway instances on the local machine.

Run the `update_apigw.sh` script with the `--help` option to see the available options:

```
./update_apigw.sh --help
```

To run the script without user interaction, specify `--mode unattended` option.

### Change the trace level

The `update_apigw.sh` script generates a trace file in the `update-output/trace` directory. Use the `--tracelevel` option to [change the level of tracing](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/tracing/#set-api-gateway-trace-levels).

### Specify a directory to back up your installation

The script takes a backup of your entire API Gateway installation directory and places it in a `tar` file in the `update-output/backups` directory. Specify a different directory using the `--backup_dir` option. To manage your own backups, use the `--no_backup` option.

## Install a Policy Studio update

You can run the `update_policy_studio.sh` script, which is available from API Gateway One Version Policy Studio update pack (for example, `APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_PolicyStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz`) to update your existing Policy Studio installation.

Running this script performs the following:

* Back up your existing `INSTALL_DIR/policystudio` directory. The backup of the installation is created at `INSTALL_DIR/backups/policystudio/<date_time>`.
* Remove old JRE versions by deleting the `INSTALL_DIR/policystudio/jre` directory.
* Unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio update over the `policystudio` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory.
* Start Policy Studio with `policystudio -clean`.

To install the Policy Studio update, download and unpack the API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio update file into a new directory. For example:

```
mkdir 77update
tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_PolicyStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C 77update
```

* You must execute the update script using the same user who installed Policy Studio.
* You must extract the tar.gz file into a new directory, and not into the existing API Gateway installation directory.
* You must also remove the `libeay32.dll` and `ssleay32.dll` files if they exist in the `INSTALL_DIR/policystudio` directory.

Run the `update_policy_studio.sh` script from the directory into which you extracted the update file (for example, `77update`), and specify your API Gateway installation directory as an argument:

```
./update_policy_studio.sh $INSTALL_DIR
```

`$INSTALL_DIR` is the base API Gateway 7.7 installation directory that contains the `policystudio` directory.

For example:

```
./update_policy_studio.sh /opt/Axway-7.7/
```

If you had applied any modifications to the `policystudio.ini` file, you must reapply them after upgrade.

### Install a Policy Studio update on Windows

For installations running on Windows 7, you must manually unzip the Policy Studio update.

The `update_policy_studio.bat` update script is available for Windows. It is located in the API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update pack (`.zip`) for Windows.

## Install a Configuration Studio update

You can run the `update_configuration_studio.sh` script, which is available from API Gateway One Version Configuration Studio update pack (for example, `APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_ConfigurationStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz`), to update your existing Configuration Studio installation.

Running this script performs the following:

* Back up your existing `INSTALL_DIR/configurationstudio` directory. The backup of the installation is created at `INSTALL_DIR/backups/configurationstudio/<date_time>`.
* Remove old JRE versions by deleting the `INSTALL_DIR/configurationstudio/jre` directory.
* Unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update over the `configurationstudio` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory.
* Start Configuration Studio with `configurationstudio -clean`

To install the Configuration Studio update, download and unpack the API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio update file into a new directory. For example:

```
mkdir 77update
tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_ConfigurationStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C 77update
```

* You must execute the update script using the same user who installed Configuration Studio.
* You must extract the file into a new directory and not into the existing API Gateway installation directory.
* You must remove the `libeay32.dll` and `ssleay32.dll` files if they exist in the `INSTALL_DIR/configurationstudio` directory.

Run the `update_configuration_studio.sh` script from the directory into which you extracted the Update file (for example, `77update`), and specify your API Gateway installation directory as an argument:

```
./update_configuration_studio.sh $INSTALL_DIR
```

`$INSTALL_DIR` is the base API Gateway 7.7 installation directory that contains the `configurationstudio` directory.

For example:

```
./update_configuration_studio.sh /opt/Axway-7.7/
```

If you had applied any modifications to the `configurationstudio.ini` file, you must reapply them after upgrade.

### Install a Configuration Studio update on Windows

For installations running on Windows 7, you must manually unzip the Configuration Studio update.

The `update_configuration_studio.bat` update script is available for Windows. It is located in the API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio update pack (`.zip`) for Windows.

## Install an API Gateway Analytics update

To install the update on your existing API Gateway Analytics 7.7 installation, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that your existing API Gateway Analytics instance and Node Manager have been stopped.
2. Remove old third-party libraries by deleting the following directories:

   ```
   INSTALL_DIR/analytics/system/lib/modules
   ```
3. Remove old JRE versions by deleting the following directories:

   ```
   INSTALL_DIR/analytics/platform/jre
   ```
4. Verify the owners of API Gateway binaries before extracting the update.

   ```
   ls -l INSTALL_DIR/analytics/posix/bin
   ```
5. Using the same user who owns the API Gateway Analytics binaries, unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Analytics update over the `analytics` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory. For example:

   ```
   tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_Analytics_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C /opt/Axway-7.7/analytics/
   ```
6. Change to the `analytics` directory in your installation:

   ```
   cd $INSTALL_DIR/analytics
   ```
7. Run the post-install script for API Gateway Analytics.

   ```
   apigw_analytics_sp_post_install.sh
   ```

## Allow an unprivileged user to run API Gateway

After updating your installation, to allow an unprivileged user to run the API Gateway on a Linux system, perform the following steps:

1. Add the following line to the `INSTALL_DIR/system/conf/jvm.xml` file:

   ```
   <VMArg name="-Djava.library.path=$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib/amd64/server:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib/amd64:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/lib/engines:$VDISTDIR/ext/$DISTRIBUTIONlib:$VDISTDIR/ext/lib:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib:system/lib:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/lib"/>
   ```

2. Allow the API Gateway to listen on privileged ports:

   ```
   setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep cap_sys_rawio=+ep' INSTALL_DIR/platform/bin/vshell
   ```

## Update API Manager

Updating API Manager is now carried out during the application of the latest API Gateway update. This will update the API Manager `config` script, which can then be pulled into a Policy Studio project. However, it is still required to perform one of the following three options to ensure that the update of API Manager performed by the API Gateway update is not overwritten by older deployments or policies.

* Policy Studio project upgrades. Importing an existing API Manager Policy Studio project will upgrade API Manager. The upgrade is also applied when creating a new project from an existing `fed` file.
* API Manager `.fed` files can be upgraded using the [upgradeconfig](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_analytics#upgradeconfig-options) script.
* The [projupgrade](/docs/apim_reference/devopstools_ref#projupgrade-command-options) script will apply API Manager updates to any existing projects.
